# Working with strings
There is a text consisting of n(n <= 20) lines, which is entered from the keyboard. The length of each line does not exceed 128 characters. Each line contains at least two words. The number of words in a line does not exceed 20. Separate words are separated from each other by one or more spaces. The first word in each line must be deleted. The output of text processing results should be performed only after the text input is completed. When processing text, it is necessary to take into account the possibility of leading and trailing spaces in the entered line. The number of spaces in the entered and processed text may not coincide. When developing a program to solve the task at hand, it is necessary to use functions to the maximum extent possible.
