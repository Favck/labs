# Working with structures
In this lab it is necessary to form an array of structures. The structures are entered from the keyboard. It is necessary to process the generated array of structures and display the results of processing on the display screen. In the program you should use functions as much as possible. For example, functions should be used to input structures, process the formed array of structures and output the results of processing. The array should contain information about the sale of books by some store. Each structure should contain the following fields: author(s), title, year of publication, cost of book purchase by the store, number of books purchased, price at sale. Calculate the profit on the sale of a book of each title. Display the information about the books whose sale did not bring profit.
