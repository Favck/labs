# Cyclic computational processes.Tabulation problem.
It is necessary to calculate on the computer the problem of calculating N values of the function y = f(x) for a number of equidistant values of x, starting from x=xnach up to x = xcon. The function y=f(x) depends on the parameter a. Output the result in the form of a table with a heading.
