# Processing of two-dimensional arrays
In this laboratory work it is necessary to perform the specified processing of a numerical two-dimensional array with an arbitrary number of rows (N) and columns (M). Each of the options contains restrictions on the maximum values of N and M. The array elements must be entered from the keyboard and a function must be developed to enter them. The processing required by the task and the output of the non-scalar result are performed with the help of functions.  Calculate the value of the modulo largest element and its index for each column of the array. N <= 10, M <= 10
