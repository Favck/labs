# Processing of one-dimensional arrays
Three numerical sequences a, b and c are given. Form two new sequences x and y. The formation is performed in two stages. At the first stage normalization of the original sequences a, b and c is performed. The normalization results in the sequences ' a , ' b and ' c . Then the sequences x and y are formed.
