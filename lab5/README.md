# Programming nested loops
In the work it is necessary to calculate the value (i) of the function y = f(x). The task variants differ in the type of function (see the table below). In odd variants of tasks it is necessary to calculate the value of the function for one value of the argument x, and in even variants it is necessary to solve the tabulation problem. When calculating the value of a function, it turns out to be necessary to calculate several sums (products). Calculation of some sums (products) may require the organization of nested loops
